intro: With a scattering of around 6,000 islands, it’s no wonder that there are still many unspoilt gems to discover. If it’s space and solitude you seek, retreat to lesser-known Greek islands like Milos, Sifnos, Andros and Naxos, where natural beauty reigns. Don’t overlook the mainland either - Messinia in the mountainous Peloponnese offers beach bliss with an extraordinary backdrop and a trove of ancient relics to explore. Or the Zagoria villages in Epirus.
