intro: "Feasting is part and parcel of Greek life - and how it could it not be, with such a bountiful natural larder? Sit all sea-salty in the shade and gorge on juicy Kalamata olives, just-caught seafood and mouth-watering grills. Each region has its own aromatic delights: sweet cherry tomatoes in Santorini, nutty Graviera cheese in Naxos and across the country, a multitude of beautiful wines."
